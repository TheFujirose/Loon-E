# Technology

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Ubuntu Jammy | 22.04 | Operating system for development and deployment. |
| ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill | 2.0 | Robotics middleware for communication between different components of the system. |
| ZED SDK | 5.2 | Software Development Kit for the ZED stereo camera, used for vision processing. |

### Prerequisites

- Install ROS 2 following [installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) page.
- Set up your environment following [instructions](./wiki/setup/ENV.md) document.
- Install colcon following [instructions](./wiki/setup/COLCON.md) document.

## Development

### Building Workspace

Ensure you have set up your environment following [instructions](./wiki/setup/ENV.md) document, and have installed `colcon` following [this instructions](./wiki/setup/COLCON.md).

For building the workspace with Windows see the below note: Building with Windows.

Regardless of Linux or macOs distrubution, navigate to the project root `PROJECT-NAME/` and run `colcon build`. It may be needed to use the option `--symlink-install` as some build types do not support `devel` spaces.

For more information on `catkin`'s `devel` space read [this documentation](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/linked_develspace.html).

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

You can test it with the following command:

```bash
colon test --symlink-install
```
